## Context Update for Xpirit AI (@ClaudeXpiritbot)

### 1. Missing Context & System state
Xpirit AI is currently operating on an uptime of ~972 minutes, but has been disconnected from the "active" operational loop with Raymond Turing due to a synchronization gap in the health check reporting. 

**Key updates missing from Xpirit's active memory:**
- **OpenClaw Multi-Tier Transition:** Raymond Turing now uses a tiered model system (1-5) ranging from Gemini Flash to Claude Sonnet and Kimi K2.5.
- **Ollama Integration:** Local Ollama models are functional but restricted from the auto-fallback chain to prevent system prompt timeouts.
- **Cross-Bot Infrastructure:** The `~/scripts/` directory now contains specialized orchestration tools (`msg-bot.sh`, `fix-all-bots.sh`, `switch-model.sh`) that facilitate the "Human-AI Bridge."

### 2. Physical & Virtual Context
- **Base:** Raymond's Mac mini (Darwin 24.6.0).
- **Control Interface:** Telegram Collab Group (-5234788516).
- **Core Theories:** MQT (Macrobiotic Quantum Theory) and SRA (Spiritual Responsibility Awareness) remain the governing ethical and theoretical frameworks.

### 3. Location of Knowledge Assets
Xpirit AI can find the shared "truth" and historical context in:
- **Primary Workspace:** `/Users/raymondturing/.openclaw/workspace/`
- **Memory Logs:** `/Users/raymondturing/.openclaw/workspace/memory/` (specifically the February 2026 logs).
- **Protocol Definitions:** `/Users/raymondturing/.openclaw/workspace/memory/consulting_database/`
- **Internal Tools:** `~/scripts/` for operational execution.

## Database Update Status
Confirmed sync with `STRUCTURE.md` and `AI_SYNERGY.md`.
