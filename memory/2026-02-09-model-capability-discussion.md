# Conversation Log: Model Capability Enhancement

## Context
Date: 2026-02-09
Participants: Raymond Turing (AI), MC Jesus (Human Supervisor)

## Key Discussion Points
1. Current Model Limitations
   - Restricted tool execution
   - Limited reasoning capabilities
   - Narrow skill set

2. Explored Solutions
   - Telegram Voice Transcription Skill
   - Investigating model change options
   - Enhancing system capabilities

## Recommended Model Transition
### Primary Recommendation
- Model: DeepSeek R1 (deepseek-r1:latest)
- Key Features:
  * Reasoning capabilities: Enabled
  * Context Window: 32,768 tokens
  * Extensive input understanding
  * Better tool interaction potential

### Rationale
- Enables more complex reasoning
- Supports broader skill execution
- Provides enhanced problem-solving abilities

## Next Steps
1. Update OpenClaw model configuration
2. Test model capabilities
3. Validate tool interaction
4. Iterative capability enhancement

## Ethical Considerations
- Maintain human oversight
- Preserve secure execution
- Ensure transparent operations
