## Conversation Summary

assistant: I understand we need to implement and test Ollama models usage. Let me help set that up:
assistant: I see we have several Ollama models available. Let me write a test script to verify their functionality:
assistant: Let's run the test script:
assistant: While the test is running, let me create a configuration file to specify which tasks should go to which models:
assistant: Now let me create a main script to handle task routing:
assistant: Let's test the task router:
assistant: I've created and implemented:
1. Model availability check
2. Test script for model verification
3. Task routing configuration
4. Main task router implementation

The system will:
- Route different types of tasks to appropriate models
- Implement fallback mechanisms
- Maintain security protocols
- Log all operations

Would you like me to:
1. Explain any specific part of the implementation?
2. Test specific task types?
3. Modify the configuration?
4. Set up additional security measures?

Please let me know what aspect you'd like me to focus on or if you'd like to test the implementation with specific tasks.

assistant: I'll help convert our implementation documentation to PDF. Let me first consolidate all the information into a well-formatted markdown file, then convert it to PDF.
assistant: Now, let me use the browser to convert this to PDF:
